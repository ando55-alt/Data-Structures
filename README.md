Project Overview

This project is a phonebook application developed as part of the DSA521S Group Project for a Namibian telecommunications company. The goal is to implement a phonebook system that uses basic linear data structures to efficiently perform operations such as inserting, searching, deleting, updating, and sorting contacts. The project was developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The phonebook system allows users to:

Add new contacts (name and phone number).

Search for contacts by name.

Display all stored contacts.

Delete or update contacts.

Features Implemented

Insert Contact: Adds a new contact to the phonebook.

Search Contact: Allows the user to search for a contact by name.

Display All Contacts: Lists all contacts stored in the phonebook.

Delete Contact: Removes a contact from the phonebook by name.

Update Contact: Updates the contact's details.
